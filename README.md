# CN_ALU
# ALU Design — Verilog Implementation
## Description

This project represents the design and implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using the Verilog language. It is a collaborative effort aimed at developing a functional ALU optimized for various arithmetic and logic operations.

## Features

Modular implementation in Verilog

Support for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)

Support for logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)

Testing using Verilog testbenches
